This page describes a research study that is being conducted by Dr. Dora Biro from the University of Rochester's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.
The purpose of the study is to learn more about how conventions are formed in humans <br><br>


If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a simple decision-making task with another subject, your partner, over multiple rounds.

The study will be followed by a short questionnaire about your experience. </p> <br>
