In this study, you and your partner will be seated next to each other and complete a simple decision-making task. <br><br>

In each round, you will be shown two colored squares. Please select one of the squares by clicking on it. <b><span style ="color:rgb(227, 187, 76)"> You and your partner will both be rewarded with 10 points if you choose the same color. You will not be able to see your partner's screen at any point.</span></b> <br> <br> 


The results of each round will appear only after both of you have made your choice. If you both chose the same color, you will see a results screen with your score for the current round as well as your total score. If you do not choose the same color, the screen will briefly flash red before the results page. You must click “Next” from the results page to proceed to the next round. The colored squares for the next round will only appear after both of you have clicked "Next" after viewing the previous round's results. <br><br>


<b><span style ="color:rgb(227, 187, 76)"> Your aim is to maximize your reward. You may not communicate with your partner during the session in any way. </span></b> <br><br>

There are a total of <b><span style ="color:rgb(227, 187, 76)">588 rounds </span></b>. You will have multiple short breaks. During these breaks, you may rest your eyes or stretch but may not communicate with your partner. Once both of you click “Next” after your break, the session will continue.<br><br>

The study will be followed by a brief (one-question) <b><span style ="color:rgb(227, 187, 76)">questionnaire</span></b> asking you about your experience. <br><br>

If you have any questions about the instructions please feel free to ask the experimenter for clarifications before starting the study.<br><br>
