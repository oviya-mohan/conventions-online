This session will be identical to the first one, with the only difference being that <b> you will be able to see your partner's screen</b>. You are still <b>not allowed to communicate with them </b>in any way. <br><br>

Just like in the first session, you and your partner will both be rewarded with 10 points <b>if you choose the same color.</b> <br><br>

Once again, <b> your aim is to maximize your reward. </b> <br><br>

This session also consists of a total of <b> 294 rounds </b>. You will have two breaks, one after 98 rounds and another after 194 rounds. During this break, you may rest your eyes or stretch but please refrain from communicating with your partner. Once both of you click “Next” after your break, the session will continue. <br><br>

This session will also be followed by a brief (one-question) <b> questionnaire </b> asking you about your experience.<br><br> If you have any questions about the instructions please feel free to ask the experimenter for clarifications before starting the session.<br><br>


Click <b> 'Next' </b> to begin.
